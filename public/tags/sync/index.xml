      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we set out to build device-sync in &lt;a href=&#34;https://museapp.com/&#34;&gt;Muse&lt;/a&gt;, we had a very strict requirement at the outset: it should be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/&#34;&gt;local-first&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most apps work by storing all of your data on the server, and send only little bits of it to each device as you use it. Then, if a document is modified on two devices at once causing a conflict, the server is the mediator to choose the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With local-first sync, the world gets much more complicated. Every device you use contains a full copy of your data. If you edit the same document from multiple devices, there is no server to mediate which device wins. Instead, both devices get a full copy of each otherâ€™s changes, and they need to independently resolve to the same state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
