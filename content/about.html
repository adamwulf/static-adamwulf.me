<p>My name is Adam Wulf, and I currently live in Houston, TX, with my beautiful wife Christi and daughter Cailyn.</p>
<p>I am currently working on <a data-id="https://museapp.com/" data-type="URL" href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a>, a whiteboard note-taking Mac and iPad app for ink, images, pdfs, and more. Bring in all your ideas, thoughts, problems, and make sense of it all in this tool-for-thought.</p>
<p>My favorite days are the ones I spend in prison volunteering with the <a href="https://www.pep.org/">Prison Entrepreneurship Program</a>. PEP leads inmates through a 9 month entrepreneurship program, culminating in a business plan pitch competition. These men leave prison with the skills to create jobs for themselves and others, and statistics prove it out, with graduate recidivism near 7% compared to above 20% Texas average or 50% national average.</p>
<p>I’m have too many <a href="/projects/">side projects</a>, also <a href="https://www.funnelanalytics.net/">Funnel Cake</a>, a marketing analytics tool, an iOS inking engine <a href="https://github.com/adamwulf/DrawUI">DrawUI</a>, and writing as I learn about machine learning into a mini-book <a href="http://milestonemade.com/building-with-neurons/">Building with Neurons</a>. I also write <a href="/2021/03/books-for-robots/">books for robots</a>.</p>
<p>I am the founder of <a href="http://milestonemade.com/">Milestone Made</a>, maker of <a href="https://getlooseleaf.com/">Loose Leaf</a>. I also maintain the personal accountability site <a href="http://www.askmeevery.com/">AskMeEvery</a>. My clients include <a href="http://flexibits.com/">Flexibits</a>, creator of the award winning calendar app <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006, I co-founded <a href="http://www.jotlet.net/">Jotlet.net</a> with <a href="http://www.keepthewebweird.com/">Buck Wilson</a> until we <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/community/blogs/jivetalks/2008/04/06/jive-acquires-jotlet">were acquired by Jive</a> on April 1st, 2008. My <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/adamwulf">full résumé</a> is available on LinkedIn.</p>
