<p>Jon Udell has a great post today on <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2011/05/23/a-new-appreciation-of-security-theater/">people’s expectactions about their security</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In his <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/ted_talk.html">recent TED talk</a> he mentions that the Tylenol incident led to tamper-proof caps — a perfect example of what Schneier likes to call “security theater”:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a homework assignment, think of 10 ways to get around it. I’ll give you one, a syringe.</p></blockquote>
<p>So far this is typical Schneier. It’s a great point, but one I’ve heard him make many times before. In the next sentence, though, he breaks new ground:</p>
<blockquote><p>But it made people feel better. It made their feeling of security more match the reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruce Schneier used to mock the theatrical dimension of security. Now it seems his thinking has evolved — and in a really interesting way. He’s alway viewed security in a relativistic way, and as a game of economic tradeoffs. Here he twists the lens to bring something else into focus: the relationship between how secure we feel and how secure we are.</p></blockquote>
<p>This hit home for me, because is exactly the same way I feel about product development, especially mobile development. We can fight all day about <a href="/2010/08/17/native-mobile-apps-vs-web-mobile-apps-is-not-a-feature-war/">mobile web vs mobile native</a>, but that’s only half of the issue. An equally important piece of software development is making sure to <a href="/2010/08/07/user-experience-vs-user-expectations/">set and exceed user expectations</a>.</p>
<p>When developing software, step 1 should be: “What are my user’s expectations? Can I change those expectations before they even launch my app? How should those expectations change how I design the user experience?”</p>
