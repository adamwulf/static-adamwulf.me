<p>I was going to just post a screenshot to twitter, but this is far too impressive to let die in a stream somewhere. i wanted to keep this in my records to draw inspiration from weeks and months from now.</p>
<p>In Google+, like many websites, there is a Send Feedback button. It is unassuming.</p>
<p><a href="/files/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-13-at-10.38.06-PM.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2136" decoding="async" height="49" src="/files/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-13-at-10.38.06-PM.png" title="Screen shot 2011-07-13 at 10.38.06 PM" width="132"/></a></p>
<p>But when you click it, you don’t get a boring “yeah what?!” text box, instead, in true Google fashion, the Google analyzes the page before the form shows:</p>
<p><a href="/files/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-13-at-10.38.42-PM.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2137" decoding="async" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="/files/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-13-at-10.38.42-PM-1024x735.png" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-13-at-10.38.42-PM-1024x735.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-13-at-10.38.42-PM-300x215.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-13-at-10.38.42-PM.png 1312w" title="Screen shot 2011-07-13 at 10.38.42 PM" width="512"/></a></p>
<p>And <em>then</em> it asks you to draw on the page to annotate your feedback!<br/>

<p>You can draw boxes and select elements on the page. It’s quick, easy, slick, amazing, neat, and useful.<br/>

<p>Extremely polished stuff. If i were to guess, the quality and usefulness of the feedback they receive is unparalled compared to other sites feedback mechanisms. Extremely cool stuff. I wish they would package it up as a product, maybe paired with Google Analytics, and let any site user embed that feedback system into their own site. Extremely cool.</p>
<p>And the fact that it’s on Google+ is particularly interesting. Its such an easy to use and useful tool that I wish I could use it to <em>share</em> content with others. Browse to site, “neat!”, click share/crop tool, click “post to Google+”, done. Reminds me of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHM8YzfDrTE&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=1080">Scoble’s interview of Convofy</a> (forgive Scoble’s lousy recording, but that few minutes of the video is pretty slick stuff.)</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>Turns out it may very well be its own Google product according to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Google+/Will-the-Google+-feedback-tool-become-a-standalone-service">this Quora question</a>. <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/googlefeedbackregisterinterest/">Tell Google here</a> to be notified if/when it’s released.</p>
