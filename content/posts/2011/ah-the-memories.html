<p>I just found a screenshot of a very old version of Jotlet â€“ then called Aurora â€“ cerca 2001. It brings back some good memories- built my senior year of high school through freshman year of college, this was <a href="http://blog.buckwilson.me/">Buck</a>â€˜s and my first and largest project together at the time. Iâ€™m uploading here for some grins, and so I can keep all these old images somewhere besides a random directory on my server somewhereâ€¦</p>
<p>Aurora â€“ precursor to <a href="http://www.jotlet.net/">Jotlet</a></p>

<p>Everything was themeable, the entire chrome could change w/ a click of the button, and check out that amazing logo in the top right: one ofÂ <a href="http://blog.buckwilson.me/">Buck</a>â€˜s first ever logo/headers ðŸ™‚ This version was built pre-Firebug, worked in IE6, everything was built <em>in tables. </em>Liberal use of iframes also going on here.</p>
