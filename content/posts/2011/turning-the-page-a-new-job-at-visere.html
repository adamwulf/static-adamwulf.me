This past week has been simply phenomenal.</p>
<p>Leaving <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/">Jive</a> is bittersweet. The people I worked with are amazing, I still believe it’s the best collection of engineering talent in Portland. The company <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/tomiogeron/2011/03/30/jive-preps-for-ipo-facebook-google-mcafee-execs-on-board/">is going places</a>. I’m proud of <a href="https://community.jivesoftware.com/community/features/blog/2011/03/16/jive-rte-survey-results-and-preview-of-improvements-in-jive-5">my work there</a>. I’ve been doing heavy lifting in JavaScript for nearly 6 years, but I’ve been <a href="http://herefilefile.com/">stretching my iOS wings</a>, and Visere gives me the opportunity to work on mobile development full time. It’s incredibly exciting to be working in a tiny startup <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/04/06/jive-software-releases-clearspace-20-acquires-jotlet/">again</a>!</p>
<p>And this move solidifies it for me – I love small companies, and not just small: tiny. At Visere, I’m employee number 9. It’s such a breath of fresh air for my day to day responsibility to include: project planning, UI/UX design, marking, recruiting, coordinating, budgeting, sales, and of course, programming. I love the variety, I love the chaos, I love fighting for life, for market share, for mind share. And most of all I love the product I’m working on.</p>
<p>To date, Visere has been primarily focused on contract design work: you may know it from products like Microsoft’s Courier tablet, the Uncommong iPhone app, or Motorola Droid branding. We’re also working on a product very much our own, and I hope to have much more detail on it soon :).</p>
