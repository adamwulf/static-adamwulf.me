<p>Quick story:</p>
<p>My sister is traveling to Sri Lanka and has a longer than expected layover in Mumbai. I log onto the internet, purchase a hotel for her while she’s on her flight, and a driver picks her up at the airport.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>That international purchase triggers an alarm on my account, so the next day when I’m shopping for groceries my card gets declined.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even supposing a mastermind criminal stole my card and bought $400 in Mumbai, here’s what just happened:</p>
<p>1. master mind steals card</p>
<p>2. master mind buys so much stuff for $400 in Mumbai</p>
<p>3. hapless customer buys a ham sandwich</p>
<p>4. sandwich declined!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Guys, if you’re smart enough to know that 99.99% of my transactions are in Portland, Oregon, and suddenly there’s a transaction in Mumbai. If you do <em>anything</em>, please reject the Mumbai transaction and continue letting me buy my groceries in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>Your state-of-the-art-from-the-year-2000-security is not making my money any safer, it’s just annoying the hell out of me.</p>
<p>I hate you Capital One.</p>
