<p>Ok ok, I’m a few hours early, but come on – awesome! I don’t know about you, but I’m just a <span style="font-size: 8pt;">tiny</span> bit excited about this! <img alt=":)" decoding="async" height="15" src="/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" width="15"/></p>
<p>More good news: it’s being released on PC and Mac (knew this) and iPhone and Nintendo DS (didn’t know this). Well, I knew an iPhone version was in the makes, but didn’t realize it was being released the same day. This will officially be my first paid-for app download for the phone. Also, according to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/05/AR2008090503501.html?hpid=sec-tech">Washington Post</a> article I’m reading:</p>
<blockquote><p>Versions for game consoles such as the Nintendo Wii are in the early stages of research and development, though the company isn’t ready to say when those might become available. A version that could be played in a browser window is also under consideration.</p></blockquote>
<p>That would be awesome indeed.</p>
