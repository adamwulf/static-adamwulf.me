<p>I was watching <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2007/s1876134.htm">a documentary of sorts</a> about Second Life a while ago, and fell in love with this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="wallacepara">TICKY FULLERTON: And yet people are very excited in-world about the idea of buying a book through Amazon [inside of <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>].</p>
<p class="wallacepara">CLAY SHIRKY: No. No-one is excited about that. People are excited about other people being excited about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s such a great quote to keep in the back of your head. I find I often like the <em>idea</em> of something, but I don’t like the <em>implementation</em> of something – and it’s an important distinction to make, especially when designing a new product. Hype is not reality, and hype is not revenue.</p>
<p>Before you begin a project, make sure that both the idea <em>and</em> the implementation are worthwhile – you’ll need to sell your customers on both.</p>
