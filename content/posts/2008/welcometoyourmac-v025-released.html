<p>New <a href="http://welcome.toyourmac.com/2008/12/welcometoyourmac-v025-released/">WTYM update</a>! WelcomeToYourMac is an easy way to access your Mac’s files/screen/apps from any browser – even your iPhone. Download your copy <a href="http://welcometoyourmac.googlecode.com/files/WelcomeToYourMac-v0.2.5.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>This latest version was a lot of fun to work on. WTYM is already my first ever Cocoa app to work on, and now it’s my first ever Cocoa app that <em>automatically updates</em>. Just like all those other fancy apps that provide a handy “Check for Updates” button, WTYM now incorporates the Sparkle framework to provide that same seemless upgrade experience.</p>
<p>And the best part? It only took about an hour to integrate and test (and I’m probably on the slower end of all you Cocoa pros out there <img alt=":P" decoding="async" height="15" src="/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" title=":P" width="15"/>).</p>
<p>Very fun stuff <img alt=":)" decoding="async" height="15" src="/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" width="15"/> Download WTYM <a href="http://welcometoyourmac.googlecode.com/files/WelcomeToYourMac-v0.2.5.zip">here</a> or <a href="http://welcome.toyourmac.com/">visit the site</a> for more info.</p>
