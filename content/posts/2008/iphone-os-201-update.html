<p>Gruber reports: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/08/04/potatoes">things are running snappier</a></p>
<blockquote><p>One thing I’ve noticed in the hour or so in which I’ve been running iPhone OS 2.0.1 is that the UI, system-wide, is snappier — typing, animations, launching apps.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope it is in fact the update and not just <a href="http://www.iphoneatlas.com/2008/07/30/a-workaround-for-slow-contacts-in-iphone-os-20/">resetting the phone</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p>In some cases, the lag can be eliminated by resetting the iPhone: Turn the iPhone off completely, by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake button (on top of the device) for a few seconds then slide the red slider. Turn it back on by holding the Sleep/Wake button until the Apple logo appears.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, poor performance generally returns after a period of normal operation post-reset.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2008/07/mojave-experiment-bad-science-bad.html">or worse</a>? 🙂</p>
<blockquote><p>Every time I do a software release, no matter how minor, even if I just change one word, in French, to another French word, someone will send me mail or post on a forum, “Thanks, this release seems a lot faster!”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m going to update tonight – I’m headed out the office door as I write this – but I hope it’s the real deal. <a href="http://www.iphoneatlas.com/2008/08/04/iphone-os-201-includes-bug-fixes/">Reported fixes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better keyboard responsiveness</li>
<li>Less lag in the Contacts application</li>
<li>Faster backups</li>
</ul>
