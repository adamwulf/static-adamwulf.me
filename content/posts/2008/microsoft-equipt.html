<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/07/02/equipt">The Gruber</a> linked to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-9982212-56.html">an article about Microsoft Equipt</a> – MS’s venture into subscription sales for Office. The bundle includes both Microsoft Office and Microsoft’s OneCare antivirus protection. Gruber notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Equipt includes Microsoft OneCare anti-virus software. So, when you buy a new Windows machine, even Microsoft encourages you to pay extra for security software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong, I’m as much not a fan of PC’s as the next guy, but I do tire from the “How telling! MS has to sell antivirus for it’s OS!”</p>
<p>We don’t scoff when auto manufacturers offer alarm systems as an option when you buy a car. Why is it so different with our computers?</p>
<p>I’m willing to bet that the primary reason for viruses on a PC are users opening email attachments and clicking links they shouldn’t. Mac’s aren’t any safer from stupid [uninformed/untrained] users than PC’s are, it’s just that PC’s have 95% of the market share, so there are <em>tons</em> more people on PC’s clicking and opening things they shouldn’t, and tons more people aiming at that giant market share.</p>
<p>The only way to protect users from themselves is to offer this type of antivirus software. If and when Apple gains a fair portion of the market, you’d better believe there will be more attacks aimed its way.</p>
