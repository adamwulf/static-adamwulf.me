<p>I recently installed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-widget-pro/">Twitter Widget Pro</a> (originally built at <a href="http://xavisys.com/wordpress-twitter-widget/">Xavysis)</a> on the site, and realized it didn’t cache the twitter feed for more than a few seconds. Naturally, I didn’t want to ping twitter every time a visitor came to the site, especially since my twitter feed doesn’t update terribly often. What’s more, I’d prefer to show the last known twitter feed instead of “twitter is down.” if the plugin can’t connect to Twitter.</p>
<p>The modified version will cache your twitter feed for 10 minutes before it pings Twitter, and will still revert to the cache if twitter is down.</p>

<p>Installation tips:<br/>
Make sure the plugin’s directory is writable on your server, otherwise it’ll revert to pinging Twitter every visitor.</p>
<p>and again, big thanks to <a href="http://xavisys.com/wordpress-twitter-widget/">Aaron Campbell</a> for the original version.</p>
