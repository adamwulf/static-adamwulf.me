<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/"><span>Ma.gnolia</span></a> <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/blog/2008/08/22/the-open-road-ahead">announced</a> that their next version will be 100% open source. What’s interesting to me, though, is <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/magnolia_goes_open_source.php">Kirkpatrick’s commentary</a> at <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">ReadWriteWeb</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just like the service Halff created, the man himself seems like a brilliant guy who you know has great ideas but communicates them poorly enough that it frustrates people pretty quickly. The value proposition is unclear, the site architecture is frustrating – right now it’s a service for standards true believers. This author uses it personally, though almost every time I do I grumble and ask if whether I should go back to using Delicious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good reminder that building a cool product is only half the battle. The UI, layout, and clarity of the site and marketing are at least equally important.</p>
