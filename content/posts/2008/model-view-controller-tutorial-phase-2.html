<p>I just finished the next phase of my <a href="/tutorials/model-view-controller-in-jquery/">jQuery MVC Tutorial series</a>. <a href="/tutorials/model-view-controller-in-jquery/phase-2/">This time</a>, I walk through how to save, edit, and delete data via AJAX with an MVC pattern. One of the major take aways from this one is showing how easy it is to roll-back the View in the unfortunate event of an AJAX request failing.</p>
<p>And of course, all the code remains clean and tidy: data is separate from presentation and all that.</p>
<p><a href="/tutorials/model-view-controller-in-jquery/phase-2/">The tutorial is here</a>.</p>
