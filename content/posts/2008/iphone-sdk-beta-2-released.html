<p>Today’s big iPhone news: The Beta 2 of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone SDK</a> has been released!</p>
<p>So what’s new in this latest version? Most notably is that Interface Builder finally works! No more building your UIs programmatically – yuck! Also fun, more sample code is included and the documentation has been updated.</p>
<p>I’ve yet to download it – I’m currently on vacation – but once I land back in Houston-town, you bet I’m going to be downloading this.</p>
<p>Good stuff all round.</p>
