I took a few days off at the end of last week till today to have an early Thanksgiving dinner with the fam. Really good times – and best of all – I had time to kick around some new code for <a href="http://welcome.toyourmac.com/">WelcomeToYourMac</a>!</p>
<p>I <a href="http://welcome.toyourmac.com/2008/11/welcometoyourmac-v021/">just released version 0.2.1</a>, which is already leaps and bounds better than the previous version (though still not close to a 1.0 <img alt=":)" decoding="async" height="15" src="/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" width="15"/>).</p>
<p><a href="http://welcome.toyourmac.com/features/">Features</a> include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Control your Mac’s screen from your iPhone / any browser</li>
<li>Control iTunes, Front Row, SlingPlayer, DVD Player, and more with the Universal Remote application</li>
<li>Peek through your Mac’s iSight webcam</li>
<li>Lots and lots of code cleanup, faster icon generation (so faster file browsing!)</li>
</ol>
