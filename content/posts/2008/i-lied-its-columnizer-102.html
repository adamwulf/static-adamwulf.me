<p>I might’ve spoken a bit too soon, but I hate going back and editing blog posts – even 5 minute old posts 🙂</p>
<p>I just added a tad more functionality to Columnizer. Any node that has the CSS class “dontsplit” won’t be split into multiple columns. This is handy for keeping tables and such in 1 column instead of split in half at the bottom of a column.</p>
<p>Also – I’ve set up a dedicated <a href="/columnizer-jquery-plugin/">project page</a> for Columnizer, so check it out for the latest news and downloads!</p>
