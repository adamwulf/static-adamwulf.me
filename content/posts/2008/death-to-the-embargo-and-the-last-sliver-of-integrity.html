<p>I purposefully try <em>not</em> to read Techcrunch, but <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/17/death-to-the-embargo/">this</a> came across the twitter and – weak as I am – I bit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One annoying thing for us is when an embargo is broken. That means that a news site goes early with the news despite the fact that they’ve promised not to. The benefits are clear … Traffic and links flow in to whoever breaks an embargo first.</p>
<p>That means it’s a race to the bottom by new sites…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From now our new policy is to break <em>every</em> embargo. We’ll happily agree to whatever you ask of us, and then we’ll just do whatever we feel like right after that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all, if you’re going to run the race to the bottom, then honesty-be-damned you’d better win.</p>
