<p>I’m excited, because today is the day that I actually started writing code for my first iPhone application! I’m going to write a Bible app for the iPhone, and it’s going to be great.</p>
<p>For this app, I’m planning on letting users download 1 or more versions of the Bible. I’ll have King James and Basic English to start – <a href="http://www.biblesql.net/" target="_blank">since those are free</a>. If lots of people actually use my Bible app, I’ll look into licensing the NASB and NIV.</p>
<p>I decided on a Bible app for a few reasons. First, for the past few months I’ve taken my iPhone to church instead of my Bible – it’s smaller and I always have it – and just looked up everything on <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/" target="_blank">BibleGateway.com</a>. This works fine, I guess, but during the lesson and sermon the teacher/pastor usually has a handful of verses queued up, and following along via the EDGE network just wasn’t cutting it – I needed something faster.</p>
<p>Second, I also figured – what are the chances that I can actually get this app done by the iPhone App Store <a href="http://www.itwire.com/content/view/17012/53/" target="_blank">launch date in June</a>? Pretty good, I think. If I can actually get a Bible app written by the time the store launches, I think there’s a good chance that it’ll become the default Bible app for a lot of people – which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>Third, this app is a great learning opportunity. It has very low graphics requirements, so no fancy coding required. It pushes the limits of what I can do: namely – create an app in the first place! I’ll also get to do some basic loading of data over the wireless connection, which is kinda cool. After finishing this app, I should be well on my way to making much “cooler” apps and games.</p>
<p>Fourth, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how I can get involved in ministry. This is something that can make a positive (albeit small?) impact for God, and at the very least, be a useful tool for a number of Christians who also happen to have iPhones who happen to have found my app… As Christi and I finish our move to Portland and get involved in a church there, this’ll be a great way to stay involved and stay focused on Christ.</p>
<p>So wish me luck! I’ll likely be posting my various discoveries as I dive into the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone SDK</a>.</p>
