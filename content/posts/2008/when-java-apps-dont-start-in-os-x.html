<p>I had a problem recently – I use IntelliJ at work, and one day it just stopped launching on my Mac altogether. Looking at the console, I found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10/23/08 4:13:16 PM idea[248] Apple AWT Startup Exception : *** -[NSCFArray insertObject:atIndex:]: attempt to insert nil </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Googling for that error I was led to <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=7195093">this Apple support thread</a>, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might want to check that the symlink:</p>
<p>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current</p>
<p>points to:</p>
<p>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/A </p>
<p>As described in this post:</p>

<p>Sure enough, my symlink was wrong! I’d completely forgotten I’d mucked around moving symlinks, and honestly can’t remember now why I ever did in the first place. Pointing the Current link back to A solved the problem, and IntelliJ starts up just fine.</p>
