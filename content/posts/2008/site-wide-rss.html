<p>Small site update, but it’s worth a mention – I’ve updated my RSS feed to include all posts across my entire site. You may or may not have known that I had 2 feeds for 2 separate blogs – one for the <a href="/">Front Page</a> and one for <a href="http://page2.adamwulf.me/">Page 2</a>. This was, of course, needlessly complicated, but the magics of <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">WordPress MU</a> and the <a href="http://wpmudev.org/project/WPMU-Sitewide-Feed-Plugin---ITDamager">Sitewide Feed Plugin</a> have simplified everything.</p>
<p>In theory, if you’ve already subscribed to my feed then your reader should pick up the changes automatically.</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet subscribed, <a href="/feed/">what are you waiting for</a>?! <img alt=";-)" decoding="async" height="15" src="/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" title=";-)" width="15"/></p>
