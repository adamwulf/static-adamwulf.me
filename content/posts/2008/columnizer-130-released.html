<p><a href="/columnizer-jquery-plugin/">Columnizer</a> has been updated!</p>
<p>Until now, Columnizer required you to set the width on your container and it would fit as many columns as it could into that width – or – it would fit as many columns into the window’s width as it could. This made it difficult to create columns for a horizontally scrolling site.</p>
<p>What if you wanted a 400px tall container to scroll horizontally for as many columns as needed? With old versions this was impossible, but now no longer!</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="/columnizer-jquery-plugin/">Columnizer</a> page for full documentation and samples.</p>
