<p>Today was a momentous day: I publicly announced the Jotlet JavaScript API!</p>
<p>I’m very excited to finally get all this past months of work out into the public eye. There is simply nothing even close to similar being offered by any other online calendar out there. I’ve emailed some tech sites and I’m hopeful that it’ll get reviewed, or at least mentioned, in an upcoming article.</p>
<p>It’s certainly worth writing about. This is basically a calendar version of the Google Maps API. Developers can now integrate a fully functional AJAX calendar directly into their site with only a few lines of code.  Pretty hot stuff if you ask me!</p>
