<p>If you haven’t used Mint to track your personal finances, then you need to start today. Mint automatically downloads all of your transactions and categorizes them for you. No hassle of entering everything manually, not even a manual sync button. It’s all just some sort of <em>financial magic</em>. Mint is the only reason I have any idea what I’m spending money on, and now I can know if I’m on/off budget where ever I am.</p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=300238550&amp;mt=8">Get it now</a>.</p>
