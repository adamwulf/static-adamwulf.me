<p>I’ve updated the <a href="http://welcome.toyourmac.com/features/">Features</a> page with more screenshots and descriptions, as well as a potential roadmap for the project. I’ve also added a poll to the <a href="http://welcome.toyourmac.com/">front page</a>, so give me your feedback! There’s a million directions this project could go, and I want to make sure I’m adding the features you’ll actually use, so let me know what you want <img alt=":)" decoding="async" height="15" src="/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" width="15"/> </p>

<p>As for v0.2.2, I’ve added two new applications: Spotlight and Running Applications. The Spotlight app lets you search your entire computer straight from your iPhone. The Applications app lets you navigate and control the menubar of all running applications, as well as launch new applications on your Mac.</p>
<p>I’ve also made lots of smaller updates: better icons and thumbnails for picture files, better meta data support for media files, album and cover art for music and movies.</p>
