<p>It’s amazing to think I’ve been on my own for nearly a year, and a busy year it’s been!</p>
<p>Most of my time has been spent on two iOS applications that I hope to announce soon, but I’ve also been fortunate enough to work with the Adonit team on their new <a href="http://adonit.net/developers/">iOS SDK</a>. They’ve done an absolutely fantastic job with their Bluetooth connected <a href="http://adonit.net/jot/">Jot Touch stylus</a>, and it was a lot of fun to help out with the iOS side of their development efforts.</p>
<p>Their new SDK provides:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extremely quick setup</li>
<li>Provides 2047 distinct pressure values from the Jot Touch</li>
<li>Advanced Palm Rejection</li>
<li>Works <em>with</em> your gestures, not against them</li>
<li>Easily configure the two stylus shortcut buttons</li>
</ol>
<p>The latest and greatest <a href="http://adonit.net/news/jot-touch-4/">Jot Touch 4 is shipping</a> to resellers now. I can confirm this is the best stylus I have ever used, and I’ve tested quite a few! It’s precise, has fantastic battery life, feels like a real pen, connects fast, just feels right in the hand. If you’re an iPad note taker, you owe it to your self to get one of these.</p>
<p>If you’re a developer, clone the new <a href="https://github.com/Adonit/JotTouchSDK">Jot Touch SDK on Github</a> and run the example app. Peek through the <a href="https://github.com/Adonit/JotTouchSDK/wiki/Getting-Started-Guide">Getting Started Guide</a> and spend a few minutes to integrate the SDK into your app!</p>
