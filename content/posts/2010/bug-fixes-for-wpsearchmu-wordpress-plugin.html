<p>Just a quick note that version 2.1.2 of the wpSearchMu plugin went live today. I’ve fixed a fairly common “Uncaught exception Zend_Search_Lucene_Exception” problem that would crop up and require an index rebuild. After you update, you shouldn’t see that error anymore.</p>
<p>I’ve also added a few checks to make sure that the plugin is installed in the correct location. Quite a few people aren’t installing to the mu-plugins folder, and that was causing some index inconsistencies and errors.</p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="/wpsearchmu/">wpSearchMu page</a> to download the latest version!</p>
