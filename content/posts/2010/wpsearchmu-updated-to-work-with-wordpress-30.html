<p>If you’re a WordPress user, then you know that Automatic is working on <a href="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/04/03/wordpress-wordpress-mu-merger-complete/">merging WordPress with WordPress MU</a>, and they’ve recently released a <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2010/04/wordpress-3-0-beta-1/">beta for the new 3.0 version</a>.</p>
<p>It’s been quite a while since I’ve updated wpSearchMu, so this was a perfect time to make sure everything’s still working with this latest release. Visit the <a href="/wpsearchmu/">wpSearchMu page</a> to download the latest version!</p>
<p>New this version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for WP 3.0</li>
<li>Better support for post tags</li>
<li>Support for searching categories</li>
<li>Support for searching author names</li>
</ul>
