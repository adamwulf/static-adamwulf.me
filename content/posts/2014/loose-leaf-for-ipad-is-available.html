<p><a href="https://getlooseleaf.com/"><img alt="Loose-Leaf-logo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4590" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="260" src="/files/2014/11/Loose-Leaf-logo.png" width="240"/></a>I’m exhausted. I’m relieved. I’m excited – <a href="https://getlooseleaf.com/">Loose Leaf for iPad</a> is finally <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/loose-leaf/id625659452?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10lNUI">available in the App Store</a>!</p>
<p>If I had to pick only one of those emotions, it would be relief. After over 2 and a half years of development, I was beginning to doubt it’d ever be ready. Even in the weeks before launch, I fixed more bugs and found more new issues than I’d ever thought possible – the date kept getting pushed back, but here we are! Even the night before launch I still didn’t have a finished layout for the website, and Christi and I stayed up until midnight recording the <a href="https://vimeo.com/adamwulf/videos">demo videos for the site</a>.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I may write up some posts about how I built various features – scissors in particular was an interesting challenge, but for now I’m just thrilled it can be seen and used by more people than just me.</p>
<p>A few fun facts: before I started Loose Leaf,</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS6 was the new hotness</li>
<li>I had never coded OpenGL</li>
<li>I only knew that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">Bézier</a>‘s were “curvy lines”</li>
<li>I had never subclassed a UIGestureRecognizer</li>
</ul>
<p>And today,</p>
<ul>
<li>I only support iOS7 and 8</li>
<li>All of the drawing is rendered in OpenGL</li>
<li>A large % of my codebase is optimizations for Bézier paths</li>
<li>The vast majority of my UIGestureRecognizers are built from scratch</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly I had no idea what I was getting into.</p>
<p>You can get Loose Leaf now in the App Store:</p>
