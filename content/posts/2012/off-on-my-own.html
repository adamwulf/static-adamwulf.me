<p>Lots of change recently!</p>
<p>The past year Iâ€™ve been working at <a href="http://visere.com/">Visere</a>, where weâ€™ve done some fantastic work for the team atÂ <a href="http://unstuck.com/">Unstuck</a>Â (even winning two <a href="http://unstuckcommunity.tumblr.com/post/22385635632/reflection-on-our-recent-awards">Webbys</a>!) and <a href="http://jawbone.com/up">Jawbone</a>, among others. In fact, the team at Jawbone was so happy with our work that they decided to acquire Visere outright and bring the team on full time, andÂ Iâ€™ve decided to take that opportunity to branch out on my own once again. Itâ€™s been nearly 5 years since <a href="https://www.jotlet.net/">Jotlet</a>, and Iâ€™m eager to get back into the game at the ground level.</p>
<p>These past few years my head has been slowly filling with new ideas and new apps that Iâ€™m eager to build. Iâ€™ve already started work on two new iOS apps that Iâ€™ll be revealing over the next few months. Iâ€™m also getting back into <a href="http://herefilefile.com/">Here, File File!</a> development, which Iâ€™m <em>extremely</em> excited about. No one on the team has ever been able to devote full time to the project, so Iâ€™m bullish that we can finally make significant updates to the app. Last, Iâ€™m just happy that Iâ€™ll have time to spend on <a href="/projects/">Columnizer and Jotbook</a> again â€“ just some fun small projects to keep the mind working.</p>
<p>And the best news?! Iâ€™ve moved back to the great state of Texas! Since Iâ€™m working for myself now, weâ€™re able to move back home and be much closer to family. Instead of $2000 in plane tickets and a 6 hour travel time, weâ€™re a mere 20 minute drive from both sets of parents. Cailyn can finally see her grandparents on a regular basis, which is just awesome for everyone.</p>
<p>First steps: pull this site out of the rubble heap and get it cleaned up, get Columnizer updated, get demos prepped for the two iOS apps iâ€™m working on, and get something brand-spanking-new released in 6 months. Wish me luck! ðŸ™‚</p>
