<p>I keep a list of random ideas, and any time I need to inject a bit of creativity into my weekend I try to pick off a small easy win and see if I can create it. Today’s idea:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Think On Your Feet:</p>
<p>Custom printed socks with thought bubble emojis all over them. So you can ‘think on your feet.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After filtering through many search results for “custom socks,” most of which were aimed at youth sports leagues, I finally found that none other than Shutterfly offers the option. A little work creating a ‘photograph’ of the Thought Bubble emoji and one Shutterfly template later, voila!</p>
