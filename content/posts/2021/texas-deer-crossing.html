<p>Over the past year, Christi and I have been on lots of ‘driving dates.’ They’re a fun way to see some sites and not have to worry about social distancing, protocols, masks, 6 feet. We can pretend the world is normal and enjoy our drive together. We’ll often drive out into the country and look over the farmland and little houses and barns, dreaming of some future retirement with a little house and a good view.</p>
<p>One gem of these drives though, is the deer crossing signs we see. Since I first saw them, I just knew they were missing something important. It was already a proper deer crossing sign, but not a proper Texas deer crossing sign. It was missing just one detail.</p>
<p>Well, today I fixed it: The Texas deer crossing sign.</p>
