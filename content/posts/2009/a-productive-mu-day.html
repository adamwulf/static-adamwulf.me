<p>I <a href="/2009/01/28/wordpress-mu-27-released/">mentioned a few days ago</a> that <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">WordPress Mu</a> was released for version 2.7, and today I finally had time to install it. The upgrade was incredibly smooth, just copied the files right on top of my existing Mu install.</p>
<p><img align="right" alt="Upgrade button" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1457" decoding="async" height="70" src="/files/2009/01/picture-32.png" title="Upgrade button" width="168"/>After logging into the admin console, I was prompted to copy/paste a small bit of code into the wp-config.php. Lastly, I ran the Upgrade script inside admin console and I was off to the races! It couldn’t have been easier. <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2009/01/28/wordpress-mu-27/">Thanks Donncha</a> for all your hard work!</p>
<p>During the upgrade, I noticed that searching my blog only returned results from 1 of my 2 blogs (<a href="http://page2.adamwulf.me/">Page 2</a> is technically a separate blog). By default, WordPress Mu searches only the currently active blog, not the entire site, and I could’ve sworn I’d fixed this before, but alas, apparently I had not.</p>
<p>Googling led me to the <a href="http://jason.ungos.com/projects/one-search-wpmu-plugin/">One Search Mu Plugin</a>, built by <a href="http://jason.ungos.com/">Jason Ungos</a>, who’s done a great job writing it up. The install was a tad clunky – you have to finagle it to get it to run the install script – but once it’s MySQL views are created the thing just works.</p>
