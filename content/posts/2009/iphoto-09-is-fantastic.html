<p>I’ve spent at least 2 minutes with iPhoto 09, and come to the following conclusion: it is fantastic.</p>
<p>After installing iLife 09 and booting up iPhoto (does anyone care about the other 3 apps? not I!), it began scanning all of my photos finding and sorting all of the people in my library.</p>

<p>Face recognition is easily the most awesome photo library feature ever. Managing hundreds and thousands of finally became manageable.</p>
