<p>I’m really excited about the <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2009/01/28/wordpress-mu-27/">newly released</a> <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">WordPress Mu 2.7</a>! <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/">Donncha</a> (also responsible for <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/wp-super-cache/">WP-Super-Cache</a>) has done a fantastic job heading up this effort and getting 2.7 mu out the door. I’ve been salivating over the new WordPress admin UI since seeing the preview screenshots many months ago, and now I can finally enjoy it.</p>
<p>Thanks Donncha!</p>
