<p>An incredibly annoying feature of <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/">iPhone 2.1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Repeat alert up to two additional times for incoming text messages</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great. So instead of vibrate meaning “You have a new text message,” it now means “You have a new text message oh wait maybe not it might be an old one.”</p>
<p>When I got a text message, it displays it on the home screen with no need to unlock the phone. This is great, because I can simply read the message, and put the phone back in my pocket. But now, 5 minutes later i get another buzz <em>for the same message I just read</em>. </p>
<p>I hate having to unlock -&gt; relock the phone just so it doesn’t give me a reminder for the message I just read. Why am I being punished for reading my text messages without unlocking my phone?</p>
<p>I sincerely wish that my iPhone buzzing meant “hey adam, something new just happened on the phone you should take a look at” instead of “hey adam, something new just happened  or maybe not it might be something I already told you about why don’t you take a look and re-read the message you just read 5 minutes ago.”</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
