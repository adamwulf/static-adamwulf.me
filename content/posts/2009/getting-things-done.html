I’ve been using the free beta for weeks slash months and <em>love it</em>. So what did I do when the dialog popped up and told me the free loading was over and it’s time to buy version 1.0? I ran for my wallet and spent that money as fast as I could!</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I also bought <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284971781&amp;mt=8">Things for the iPhone</a>, and I’ve never been more organized or productive. This is a fantastic application. It’s clean, polished, organized, and <em>gets things done</em>.</p>
<p>Thank you <a href="http://culturedcode.com/">Cultured Code</a>.</p>
