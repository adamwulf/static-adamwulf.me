<p>The past few months have been an exciting transition for me – I recently joined the team at <a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a> building a sense-making-more-than-a-whiteboard-deep-thinking iPad app.</p>

<p><a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a> is a working set of your thoughts – it sits right between your short term memory and your long term memory: it’s your working memory. It helps you make sense of things that just don’t quite make sense. It’s a whiteboard with ink, but also images, text, PDFs, and files, and more. It’s a canvas that expands with your thoughts. It’s nested boards-within-boards because some thoughts need a bit more space to grow.</p>
<p>Years ago I worked on <a href="https://getlooseleaf.com/">Loose Leaf</a>, a simple paper metaphor on the iPad for notes and pictures, but in so many ways <a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a> has exceeded my initial ambitions, and I couldn’t be more excited to join their team and contribute to the shared vision.</p>
<p>The chrome of <a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a> is entirely minimal, and the majority of functionality can be accessed by a few quickly learned gestures. What really sets Muse apart is how powerful these few gestures can be when used together, the videos below are just a small sampling of the <a href="https://museapp.com/handbook">Muse Handbook</a>, and show how this simplicity keeps disruptive context changes at bay while you work.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/to-move-ink-only.mp4"></video><figcaption>The eraser isn’t the only quick-use with a finger down on the screen. Place two fingers on the screen to select ink and move. Simple gestures that keep you in the flow of thought.</figcaption></figure>
<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/to-excerpt.mp4"></video><figcaption>And you can excerpt an image just as easily as moving ink. All of this possible with fewer gestures than can be counted on one hand, simplicity at its finest.</figcaption></figure>

<p><a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a> is far and away the most exciting product I’ve worked on in the course of my career, and we’re just getting started. Muse is a tool-for-thought that allows truly immersive deep work.</p>
