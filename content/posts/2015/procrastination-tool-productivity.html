<p>There’s a thousand small things that I need to get done during the week. They’re only mildly the same week-to-week, and they all individually don’t take up much time at all, but together they eat far more of my productivity than they deserve. I’d found that I was spending far too much time context-switching between my real work – programming – and these other smaller tasks. <a href="http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/">Programming is the sort of job that doesn’t work well with small distractions</a>, and these small tasks were eating far more of my time than they deserved. Something needed to change.</p>
<p>So a few months ago I started an experiment – instead of doing these little things as they came up during the week, I would procrastinate- er, schedule- all of that time for a single day: Tuesday.</p>
<p>It’s a simple change – an obvious one in hindsight – Instead of replying to emails immediately or scheduling calls for that afternoon, I decided to completely ignore them until just 1 day a week. If I needed to meet with someone, “how’s next Tuesday work for you?” If I needed to write a new blog post – Tuesday’s the day. Replying to emails? Tuesday. Generi-task that’s not crucial to building great products? Tuesday.</p>
<p>It’s a simple change, but it’s let me push all of my context-switching tasks into just 1 time block, which has freed up the rest of my week for dramatically fewer distractions as I program. I’ve dubbed Tuesday as my “fake productivity” day – it’s for all the things that I genuinely do need to do, but at the same time don’t help me build better software. My “real productivity” – building stuff – has been much more efficient now that I’ve moved most of my distractions out of the way.</p>
<p>It’s a habit I highly recommend.</p>
