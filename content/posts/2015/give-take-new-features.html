<p>Every WWDC brings unexpected changes, and this year is no different. While I’m excited about many of the new announcements this year, I quickly realized that one of my favorite <a href="https://getlooseleaf.com/">Loose Leaf</a> features will breath its last with the launch of iOS 9 later this month: swipe from the edge to turn the page.</p>

<p>Up through iOS 8, you can quickly peek through pages by swiping two fingers from the left or right edge of the screen. In iOS 9 however, that same swipe from the edge will bring up the new split-screen multi-tasking view instead! I can’t even count the weeks I spent developing and testing that custom bezel-gesture, so it’s particularly sad for me to see it go. Even more – I’m discouraged that custom bezel-gestures are entirely out-of-scope for app developers from here on out – iOS system gestures now cover the top/bottom/left/right bezels.</p>
<p>There are plenty of my fellow note/sketch apps in the store who’ve also lost their page-turn gestures, so now the rush is on to fill in the new gaps in our UI. Luckily there’s plenty of other gestures in Loose Leaf to switch between pages – pinching to list view or simply turning the pages with two fingers, but the peek is gone, and I’ll miss it.</p>
